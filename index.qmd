### Bio

I am a highly skilled and research-driven PhD statistician specializing in developing and applying advanced statistical modeling techniques to analyze complex ecological data sets.

My research interest includes

-   *Ecological statistics,*

-   *Spatial and spatio-temporal modelling,*

-   *Spatial Capture-Recapture models,*

-   *N-mixture models,*

-   *Dynamic Occupancy models,*

-   *Objective priors,*

-   *Bayesian Model and Variable selection,*

-   *Bayesian Non-parametric methods,*

-   *Theory and Applications, Computational Methods.*

On a personal note, I find enjoyment in frequenting the gym, participating in outdoor activities, and setting aside time to engage in play with pets.

On this site I keep [my CV](CV.pdf) and a list ofÂ [projects](projects.qmd) and [presentations](talks.qmd).
