    "text": "Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Caste‑Specific Demography and Phenology in Bumblebees: Modelling BeeWalk Data.\nBumblebees are extraordinarily important components of the ecosystem, providing pollination services of vast economic impact and functioning as indicator species for changes in climate or land use. Declines, either of distribution or abundance, are thus of serious concern from agricultural and economic viewpoints as well as from a conservation point of view.  The Beewalk citizen science scheme was established by Bumblebee Conservation Trust to monitor the abundance of bumblebees in the UK. Volunteers walk along transects counting the number of bumblebees they detect and identifying their species and caste, where possible. However, the resulting data are incredibly sparse, introducing a computational challenge on a spatial scale. Consequently, we develop a novel Bayesian dynamic mixture model for Beewalk citizen science data that accounts for sparsity and enables spatio-temporal modelling. This framework produces invaluable information on caste-specific and area-specific demographic parameters such as phenology and relative abundance, amongst others.\nHere are the slides introducing the modelling framework and possible results BeeWalk EURING Talk."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using only spatially replicated counts from unmarked individuals, N-mixture models provide an attractive framework to obtain estimates of population size by accounting for imperfect detection. The robustness of N-mixture models has been examined in detail in a classical inference framework. However, to our knowledge, only a small number of such studies have been carried out on N-mixture models in a Bayesian setting. In this paper, we consider fitting N-mixture models within a Bayesian framework. To aid implementation, we apply a new proper objective prior distribution to N-mixture models. Using simulated data, we compare this new proper objective prior to approximations of the popular objective prior, Jeffreys prior, and find that these prior distributions perform similarly in terms of model inference. Importantly, we find that when the detection probability is small, using priors that are concentrated at zero, even with large variance, expected population size can be considerably underestimated. Large estimates of expected population size were also found, evident by the bimodal density of posterior medians obtained for simulated data. Additionally, we consider an extensive class of N-mixture models and investigate model selection using the Watanable-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) in a wide range of scenarios to examine the sensitivity of WAIC to likelihood specification. We find that WAIC computed from the conditional likelihood produces misleading results favoring more complicated models than the true model. Contrary, WAIC computed using the marginal likelihood correctly selects the true model with a high probability. Hence, model selection of N-mixture models should be obtained from WAIC using the marginal likelihood, not the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate the usefulness/importance of employing these methods in two real datasets. Hence, this work can be considered a template for how to specify and select N-mixture models in a Bayesian context.  We briefly investigate parameter identifiability of N-mixture models using Data cloning.\nTO BE SUBMITTED TO METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION.\nLatest draft available here."

    "title": "A New Modeling Framework for Roost Count Data.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Roost counts, where individuals of a species are counted whilst arriving or departing from their roost site, are an important monitoring tool for several species around the world. However, the raw count data are an underestimate of the size of the monitored population at any one time because of individuals temporarily not using the roost (temporary emigration, TE) and because the probability of detection of individuals, even when using the roost, is typically much lower than one (observation error). In this paper, we develop a novel modelling framework for estimating population size, from roost count data, while accounting for both TE and observation error. Our framework builds on the popular class of N-mixture models but extends them in a number of ways. Specifically, we introduce two model classes for TE, a parametric, which relies on temporal models, and a non-parametric, which relies on Dirichlet process mixture models. Both model classes give rise to interesting ecological interpretations of the TE pattern while being parsimonious in terms of the number of parameters required to model the pattern. When accounting for observation error, we use mixed-effects models and implement an efficient Bayesian variable selection algorithm for identifying important predictors for the probability of detection. We demonstrate our new modelling framework using an extensive simulation study, which highlights the importance of using mixed-effects models for the probability of detection and illustrates the performance of the model when estimating population size and underlying TE patterns. We also assess the ability of the corresponding variable selection algorithm to identify important predictors under different scenarios for observation error and its corresponding model. When fitted to two motivating data sets of parrots, our results provide new insights into how each species uses the roost throughout the year, on changes in population size between and within years, and on important predictors for observation error. \nSUBMITTED TO ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS.

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the main aims of wildlife disease ecology is to identify how disease dynamics vary in space and time and as a function of population density. However, monitoring spatio-temporal and density-dependent disease dynamics in the wild is challenging because the observation process is error-prone, which means that individuals, their disease status and their spatial locations are unobservable, or only imperfectly observed. In this paper, we develop a novel spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) model motivated by an SCR data set on European badgers (Meles Meles), naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis). Our model accounts for the observation process of individuals as a function of their latent activity centres, and for their imperfectly observed disease status and its effect on demographic rates and behaviour. This framework has the advantage of simultaneously modelling population demographics and disease dynamics within a spatial context. It can therefore generate estimates of critical parameters such as population size; local and global density by disease status and hence spatially-explicit disease prevalence; disease transmission probabilities as functions of local or global population density; and demographic rates as functions of disease status. Our findings suggest that infected badgers have lower survival probability but larger home range areas than uninfected badgers, and we found no clear evidence of density-dependence in disease transmission. We also present an extensive simulation study, considering different scenarios of disease transmission within the population, and our findings highlight the importance of accounting for spatial variation in disease transmission and individual disease status when these affect demographic rates. Collectively these results show our new model enables a better understanding of how wildlife disease dynamics are linked to population demographics within a spatio-temporal context.\nSUBMITTED TO ENVIRONMETRICS.
